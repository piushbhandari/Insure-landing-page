    We’re different
  
    Snappy Process
  
    Our application process can be completed in minutes, not hours. Don’t get 
    stuck filling in tedious forms.
  
    Affordable Prices
  
    We don’t want you worrying about high monthly costs. Our prices may be low, 
    but we still offer the best coverage possible.
  
    People First
  
    Our plans aren’t full of conditions and clauses to prevent payouts. We make 
    sure you’re covered when you need it.
